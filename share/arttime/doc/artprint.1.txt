ARTPRINT(1)                     Artprint Manual                    ARTPRINT(1)

NAME
       artprint - print text art from arttime's collection

SYNOPSIS
       artprint [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       artprint prints text art with optional title/subtitle in center of
       terminal screen, or indented according to page height/width passed as
       optional arguments.

       Why artprint? To provide a consistent display of text art in multiple
       CLI applications. While artprint is a program in the arttime(1)
       repository and used by arttime to print art on screen, it's use is not
       limited to arttime. One can utilize artprint to bring the beauty of
       text art to other aspects of development environment.

       Future versions of artprint might have bigger interface changes than
       arttime. If you do integrate artprint in your development environment,
       please check that your integration works well after upgrading arttime.
       While artprint can be used independent of arttime, it is shipped as
       part of arttime's releases. Upgrading arttime to a newer version can
       bring changes to artprint that break the way you were using it in past.

OPTIONS
       There are options to set art, titles, their colors, styling, and etc.
       artprint looks for text art files in a directory (artdir) relative to
       its own location. Directory path has name 'arttime' instead of
       'artprint' as artprint is part of arttime(1) project.

           artdir=<directory_of_arttime>/../share/arttime/textart/

       -a <name>
           name of a-art file from artdir (default: butterfly)

       -t <str>
           title message placed under art (default: line-1 from a-art file)

       -s <str>
           sub-title message (default: none, not printed unless specified)

       --random
           select and display a random art from arttime's collection. When
           passed, user should not pass option -a.

       --ac <num>
           art color,[1] value between 0-15 (default 1 (red))

       --tc <num>
           title color,[1] value between 0-15 (default 2 (green))

       --sc <num>
           sub-title color,[1] value between 0-15 (default 6 (cyan))

       --theme <light|dark>
           when given it overrides above color options (default dark)

       --style <num>
           style for title and sub-title strings. For instance, value of 0
           uses regular underline and value of 1 uses curly underlines. Style
           1 uses more Unicode glyphs, and 0 is more ASCII friendly. Not all
           terminal emulators support curly underlines. Possible values: [0,1]
           (default: 0)

       --width <num>
           width of page (default: terminal width)

       --height <num>|"term"
           height of page. Also accepts a special string "term" to calculate
           tty height in it's environment. (default: 0)

       --version

           it's own version number.
